## AUTO TRADING EXECUTION FIXES - COMPLETE

### ISSUE IDENTIFIED
The auto trading system was generating signals but not executing them due to a missing payload in the execute_signal endpoint call.

### ROOT CAUSE
1. **Missing Signal Payload**: The dashboard was calling `/auto_trading/execute_signal` with an empty POST request, but the backend expected a `SignalData` object with required fields:
   - symbol: str
   - signal: str  
   - confidence: float
   - price: float
   - timestamp: str

2. **Missing Price Field**: The current signal endpoint was not providing the current market price, causing the dashboard to send price: 0.0

### FIXES IMPLEMENTED

#### 1. Updated Dashboard Callback (`dashboard/callbacks.py`)
Fixed the `execute_trading_signal` function to:
- First fetch the current signal from `/auto_trading/current_signal`
- Extract required fields to create proper SignalData payload
- Send the complete payload to `/auto_trading/execute_signal`
- Handle response status correctly

#### 2. Enhanced Backend Signal Generation (`backend/main.py`)
- Added import for `get_binance_price` from `price_feed.py`
- Updated `/auto_trading/current_signal` endpoint to include real-time price from Binance API
- Added error handling for price fetch failures (defaults to 0.0 with warning)

#### 3. Fixed Backend Port Conflict
- Resolved port 8001 binding conflict by stopping conflicting processes
- Ensured backend starts successfully with all endpoints available
