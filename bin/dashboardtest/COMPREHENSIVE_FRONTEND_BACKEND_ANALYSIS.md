    if response.ok:
        # Process real data from backend
        return process_backend_data(response.json())
    else:
        # Intelligent fallback with simulated data
        return create_fallback_display(response.status_code)
except Exception as e:
    # Comprehensive error handling
    return create_error_display(str(e))
```
