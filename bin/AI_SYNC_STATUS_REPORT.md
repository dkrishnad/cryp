## 🔧 **QUICK FIXES NEEDED:**

### **Fix 1: Basic ML Model API**
```python
# Current (failing): 
requests.post("/model/predict_batch", json=[{features}])

# Should be:
requests.post("/model/predict_batch", json={"data": [{features}]})
```

### **Fix 2: Transfer Learning Service**
```bash
# Restart transfer learning endpoints
python minimal_transfer_endpoints.py
```
